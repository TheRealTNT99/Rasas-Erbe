Dhampir aren’t properly a species on their own. They are the result of a pregnant female falling victim to the predations of the undead. These include but are not limited to: mummy rot, ghoul fever, a vampire’s drain ability, and allip madness. Similarly, long term exposure of a bloodline to a [bosetor](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/kobos-cplsoletrain/a/bosetor-article) can result in the occasional birth of a Dhampir. 

#### Physical Description

Dhampir tend to be either on the dark end of the spectrum of their parent race or on the light end, rarely displaying coloration in between.
Their hair is usually black, and their eyes are usually corpse-pale blue. They regularly display some physical trait hinting at the nature of their undead ‘parent:’ Fangs from a vampire, a thin build or ashy, wrinkled skin from a mummy, a manic smile or habit of manic thinking out loud from an allip, or a wiry stature with pallid skin from a ghoul.
Dhampir born of exposure to bosetors often display more supernatural traits such as 'reverse shadows' or a lack of reflections.
#### Biology

Aside from the minor cosmetic changes, an examination of a Dhampir would show it to be a perfectly normal member of the parent race. The only exception is the blood.
Within every undead, there is a channel to the negative energy plane in the form of rips and tears in the veil between planes.
These tiny rips allow the negative energy to animate the corpse in parody of life.
Dhampir were tainted in the womb by this negative energy, and similar tears in the veil opened. Their innocent souls opened these rips to the positive energy plane instead, suffusing their blood with energy.
For most mundane matters, this is simply an efficient solvent or acid.
Alchemists eagerly seek it for this purpose, and often offer to pay for blood donations if they come across a dhampir. The blood reacts with the negative energy supporting undead physiology, however, violently cancelling each other out.
