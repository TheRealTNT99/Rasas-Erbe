---

An ethereal barrier of spikes, made of magical force, interposes itself between you and an attacker. Until your next turn, when you are hit by a melee attack, the barrier reduces the damage you are dealt by {@dice 2d4}, and deals the same amount of piercing damage to the attacker. The shield is ineffective against ranged attackers, but still provides a +2 bonus to AC (treat as half cover) against them for the duration.

**At Higher Levels**
When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 1st level, increase the spell's effect by an additional {@scaledice 2d4|1-9|1d4} for every slot level above 1st.

**Classes:** #Druid, #Ranger, #Sorcerer, #Wizard
