**Casting Time:** #1-reaction
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, , S, M (a tiny silver cage worth 100 gp)
**Duration:** 8 hour

---

This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.





A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using {@spell see invisibility} or {@sense truesight}) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.
