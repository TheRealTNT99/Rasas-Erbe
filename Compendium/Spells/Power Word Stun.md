---

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is {@condition stunned}. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The {@condition stunned} target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
