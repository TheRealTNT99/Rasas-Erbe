**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the {@condition frightened} creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
