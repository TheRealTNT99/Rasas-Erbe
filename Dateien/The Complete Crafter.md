# Crafting Basics
DURING ADVENTURES AND TRAVELS, A character can collect and harvest a series of materials and objects to craft common and special equipment. This supplement expands the following crafting rules, which can also be found in the [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]].

## Crafting an Item
A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of non-magical gear. 

***Resources and Resolution.*** In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the item's combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency               | Items                                       |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| [[Herbalism kit]]         | [[Antitoxin (vial)]], [[Potion of healing]] |
| [[Leatherworker's tools]] | [[Leather armor]], boots                    |
| [[Smith's tools]]         | Armor, weapons                              |
| [[Weaver's tools]]        | Cloaks, robes                               |

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

***Crafting Magic Items.*** Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

*Potions of healing* and *spell scrolls* are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see [[The Complete Crafter#Potion of Healing Creation|Brewing Potions of Healing]] later in this section and the [[The Complete Crafter#Scribing a Spell Scroll|Scribing a Spell Scroll]] section, below.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need to access to.

##### Magic Item Ingredients
| Item Rarity  | CR Range |      |
|:---|:----:|:----:|
|  Common  | 1-3 |
|  Uncommon  | 4-8 |
|  Rare  | 9-12 |
|  Very Rare  | 13-18 |
|  Legendary  | 19+ |

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating a *mariner's armor* might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a [[staff of charming]] might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a [[staff of power]] might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic–a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

##### Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost
| Item Rarity  | Workweeks* | Cost*     |
|:---|:----:|----:|
|  Common  | 1 | 50 gp    |
|  Uncommon  | 2 | 200 gp    |
|  Rare  | 10 | 2,000 gp    |
|  Very Rare  | 25 | 20,000 gp    |
|  Legendary  | 50 | 100,000 gp    |
<div style='font-family: Scaly Sans;font-size: 13px'
<span>
*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll.
   
To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a non-magical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

***Complications.*** Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

##### Crafting Complications
| ``dice: 1d6`` | Complication                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | Rumors swirl that what you're working on is unstable and a threat to the community.*                       |
| 2             | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.*                                                       |
| 3             | A local wizard shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you.                              |
| 4             | A powerful noble offers a hefty price for your work and is not interesting in hearing a no for an answer.* |
| 5             | A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secret lore to fuel your work.*                                   |
| 6             | A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.*                                |

\*Might involve a rival

***Brewing Potions of Healing.*** *Potions of healing* fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the [[herbalism kit]] can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

##### Potion of Healing Creation
| Type             | Time        |      Cost    |
| :--------------- | :---------- | -----------: |
| Healing          | 1 day       |     25 gp    |
| Greater healing  | 1 workweek  |    100 gp    |
| Superior healing | 3 workweeks |  1,000 gp    |
| Supreme healing  | 4 workweeks | 10,000 gp    |

## Scribing a Spell Scroll
With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a *spell scroll.*

***Resources.*** Scribing a *spell scroll* takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version of the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

##### Spell Scroll Costs
| Spell level  |    Time | Cost   |
|:---:|:----|----:|
|  Cantrip  |    1 day | 15 gp   |
| 1st |    1 day | 25 gp   |
| 2nd |    3 days | 250 gp   |
| 3rd |    1 workweek | 500 gp   |
| 4th |    2 workweeks | 2,500 gp   |
| 5th |    4 workweeks | 5,000 gp   |
| 6th |    8 workweeks | 15,000 gp   |
| 7th |    16 workweeks | 25,000 gp   |
| 8th |    32 workweeks | 50,000 gp   |
| 9th |    48 workweeks | 250,000 gp   |

***Complications.*** Crafting a *spell scroll* is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for the activity. Every workweek spent scribing brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Scribe a Scroll Complications table.

##### Scribe a Scroll Complications
| d6  | Complication|
|:---|:----|
| 1 | You bought up the last of the rare ink used to craft scrolls, angering a wizard in town. |
| 2 | The priest of a temple of good accuses you of trafficking in dark magic.* |
| 3 | A wizard eager to collect one of your spells in a book presses you to sell the scroll. |
| 4 | Due to a strange error in creating the scroll, it is instead a random spell of the same level. |
| 5 | The rare parchement you bought for your scrolls has a barely visible map on it. |
| 6 | A thief attempts to break into your workroom.* |

# Collecting Materials
When adventuring, it's possible to find common and exotic materials which are used to craft new objects and gear. In this section you will find new rules for collecting materials, which can be used for crafting new weapons, armor, clothing, and other kind of gear. This document expands the crafting rules found in the downtime revisited section of the [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]] to focus on the process of collecting new materials for crafting magic items.

## Material Sources
When the characters are camping in a forest, exploring an abandoned mine, diving in the ocean, or surviving in a dungeon, they can also search and gather raw materials for crafting. 

Every day, characters can collect materials while traveling through the wild or exploring a dungeon or a cave. These materials can be found by mining a mineral vein, gathering plants and herbs for potions and other concoctions, and harvesting or collecting creature parts for later use. 

### Creatures
Creature parts are mostly used as alchemical materials and for creating armor and weapons. Others take some of the creature parts as trophies and decorations for their armor and houses.

When characters hunt down or finds a dead creature they can attempt to harvest some parts for crafting and surviving. Since creatures and monsters varies in type and rarity, the characters must make a specific ability check. The Extracting Creature Parts table shows which ability check a character must make to extract some parts from a creature. The DC for harvesting a part equals to 12 plus half the creature challenge rating (creatures with a challenge rating lower than 2 don't add it to the DC).

##### Extracting Creature Parts
| Creature Type | Ability Check|
|:---|:----|
| Aberration, construct, dragon, elemental, <br> ooze | Arcana |
| Beast, giant, humanoid, monstrosity, plant | Nature |
| Celestial, fey, fiend, undead | Religion |

The number of checks a character can make depends of the size of the creature. Every harvest check takes 1 hour to complete, even if the character fails the roll. Each successful check gives the character a number of units which can be used for crafting new pieces of equipment, objects, and other kind of gear. 

The DM determines the number of checks the party can make for each part they want to harvest. 

The DM also decides the amount of units a character get, but the number of units cannot exceed the maximum shown in the table below. 

| Creature <br> Size | Maximum <br> Checks | Maximum Units <br> per Check |
|:----|:------:|:------|
| Tiny  | 1 | 1/4 unit |
| Small  | 2 | 1/2 unit |
| Medium | 2 | 1 unit |
| Large | 3 | 2 units |
| Huge | 4 | 3 units |
| Gargantuan | 5 | 4 units |

For example, characters can make multiple checks for harvesting various units of scales from a large red dragon, but they can make only one check for harvesting the heart (which gives only 1 unit instead of two).


> [!info] Creature Essence
> All creatures are divided in various types, and characters can extract a unit of that essence using an [[Essence Extraction Device]]. You can read more about that magic item in the [[The Complete Crafter#New Magic Items|New Magic Items]] section.

#### Parts Values
The value of each harvested unit goes from 1% to 50% of the experience of the creature. The harvested parts of common creatures have a value of 1% of the creature's experience, while the rarer creature's parts value is close to 50% of the creature's experience. You can determine the values of each extracted part in the following table.

##### Units Value

| CR        | Creature rarity | Unit value               |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :----------------------- |
| 6 or less | Common          | 1% of the creature exp.  |
| 7-12      | Uncommon        | 5% of the creature exp.  |
| 13-18     | Rare            | 10% of the creature exp. |
| 19-24     | Very Rare       | 25% of the creature exp. |
| 25+       | Legendary       | 50% of the creature exp. |

As examples, if a character harvest one unit of feathers from a hippogriff (CR 1), the value of the feather unit will be 1% of the base experience (200 exp), which is 2 gp. A unit of pseudodragon's scales is worth 5 sp (CR 1/4), and a unit of an adult blue dragon's scales is worth 1,500 gp (CR 16).

### Other Materials
In addition to the materials a character can collect from creatures, there're plenty of other sources for gathering raw materials for crafting and other uses. These materials are divided in **minerals** (like [[orichalcum]] and [[Compendium/Materials/Obsidian|obsidian]]), **non-minerals** (like [[darkwood]]), and **plants and herbs**.

#### Minerals
Minerals are earthen materials used for making armor, weapons, and when using exotic materials, those pieces of gear gain special qualities.

To extract minerals, a character must use a [[miner's pick]] and make a Strength (athletics) check. The DC for extracting ores is always 15. On a success, the character collects a number of ore units equal to ``dice: 2d4`` + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 unit). 

If needed, the character must make an Intelligence (Nature) check first to find a vein or a place where the ores are. 

> [!info] Foraging Variant: Getting Meat
> While the characters can forage to survive on the wilderness, they also can hunt down and kill a creature to harvest the meat and use it as food. The meat they yield spoils after a single day if uneaten. Eating spoiled meat might require a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) to avoid throwing up the food or getting diseased.
> 
> A character can make a Wisdom (Survival) check to try to collect meat as food. The DC for the check is typically 15, but it’s up to the DM to modify the DC. The amount of meat harvested is determined by the creature size, as shown in the Creature Food Yield table below.
> 
> Getting meat does not count on the maximum harvest checks you can make to harvest a creature, but doing so might destroy other parts such as the creature hide and organs.
>
> ##### Creature Food Yield
> | Creature Size | Food Gained |
> |:----|:---|
> | Tiny  | 1 lb. |
> | Small  | 4 lb. |
> | Medium | 16 lb. |
> | Large | 32 lb. |
> | Huge | 64 lb. |
> | Gargantuan | 128 lb. |
>
> ##### Drinking Blood
> While characters can also collect blood in vials as crafting and alchemy resources, in other cases, the extreme need of water can drive someone to harvest a creature's blood and drink it to stay alive. When a character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check to collect meat as food, it can also collect a number of gallons of blood equal to half the amount of meat. A character drinking blood must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) to avoid vomiting.  
>
> ##### Cooking and Purifying
>Even though a character can eat meat or drink blood from any creature for nourishment, some of them can be poisonous, be diseased or cause other special effects to the character if its not prepared or cooked correctly.

#### Non-Mineral Materials
There're also other materials which are not ores or gemstones, such as wood, stone, and [[Compendium/Materials/Coral|coral]] that can be also used to craft weapons, armor, and other kind of items and gear. 

For collecting those materials, a character needs to make a Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity check, depending on the material (DC 15). On a success, the character collects a number of units equal to ``dice: 2d4`` + its Constitution modifier (minimum 1).

For example, if a character wants to collect some units of [[darkwood]], he must make a Strength (Athletics) check to cut down the tree with an axe and get the material. On a success, the character collects a number of [[darkwood]] units equals to ``dice: 2d4`` + its Constitution modifier. 

The time used for extracting minerals and other materials equals to 1 day of downtime activity. This represents all the time the character uses to find and extract the materials.

#### Plants and Herbs
Plants are mostly used for creating alchemical mixtures, cooking, and in some cases for creating dyes for painting.

To gather plants, herbs and other similar resources the character must success a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a success, the character collects a number of units equal to 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 unit).

The time used for gathering equals to 1 hour for each check, and you can make a number of checks per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). 

## Buying and Selling 
It's up to the DM to determine if collected materials can be sold (and in some cases, bought). The value of each unit depends of the material. For more information about special materials and values, read the material description section of this supplement.

##### Keeping Parts Chilled
If characters wants to keep some creature parts for later use, they need to maintain the parts in a chilled place to avoid decomposition. Check the [[Bag of Colding]] later in this supplement.

## Plants and Herbs by Areas
In the following tables you can see examples of plants for various environments. When a character succeeds a roll to gather plants and herbs, the DM can chose one of the following plants or roll a d20 to determine it randomly. You can read more information about each plant in the material description section.

# Modular Crafting
While characters can craft a specific item (non-magical and magical), they can also craft their own gear depending on what they want. To create an object with special materials, a character needs an amount of material units for crafting it.

As general rule, a character needs 3 units of the same material for crafting a medium-sized creature armor or clothing, and 2 units of the same material for weapons, shields, and 10 units of ammunition. For bigger creatures, the character needs twice the amount of materials used for each size increment, and for smaller creatures, the character needs only half materials per each size smaller than medium. 

Since magic items are more complex and unique features, a character might require more units of the same material or some units of different materials to craft the magic item.

## Material Description
In the following section you can find a list of materials, their unit value and properties. Some of this materials might have other special features. For example, an armor made with dragon bones could grant you resistance to the dragon's breath weapon damage type. 

Unless the materials are used for crafting magic items, a piece of gear crafted with any of these materials is non-magical.

### Creatures
There are a lot of different creatures in *Dungeons and Dragons*, and because of that, this section have some general creature parts that can be used for crafting. Feel free to create your own specific creature materials (such as using one unit of aboleth tail for crafting a magical [[+2 whip]]).

#### Bone
A series of bones joined together, mostly used by shamans and wildlings.

**Unit value:** Determined by the creature's CR.

**Armor:** Replaces the metal. While wearing a medium or heavy armor (non hide) made with bones, you gain a +3 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) checks you make.

**Weapon:** Replaces the metal and wood.

#### Chitin
These flexible shells of chitinous creatures such as giant crabs or remorhaz are used to craft armors, known to be lighter than metallic armors.

**Unit value:** Determined by the creature's CR.

**Armor:** Replaces the metal. While wearing a medium armor (non hide) made with chitin, the armor's dexterity bonus increases by 1. 

Heavy armors made with chitin reduce the Strength requirement by 1.

#### Creature Essence
All creatures are different, but they're grouped up in types which determines their fundamental nature.

**Unit value:** Determined by the creature's CR.

**Weapon:** Can be used to craft specific slaying weapons such as an *arrow of dragon slaying.* 

**Other:** Can be used to craft specific potions, alchemical concoctions, and magic items such as a [[brazier of commanding fire elementals]].

#### Ellond Hide
This brown-orange hide is harvested from desert and dry areas creatures.

**Unit value:** Determined by the creature's CR.

**Armor:** While wearing clothing or a hide armor made with ellond hide, fire damage you take is reduced by 3. 

Harvested ellond hide from a CR 9 or higher creature can be used to craft a [[hide armor of fire resistance]]. 

#### Monster Feathers

> [!info] Optional Rules: Material Resistance
> Every non-magical armor or weapon made with special materials have a number of **resistance points**. If the points are reduced to 0, the piece of equipment is broken and you need to repair it to use it again.
> 
> The points are reduced in the following events:
> - When you make an attack with a weapon made with a special material and you roll a 1, the resistance points of the weapon are reduced by 1 point.
> - When you take a critical hit from an opponent, it reduces your armor resistance points by 1.
> 
> Each reduced point also reduces the attack bonus and damage dealt for weapons, and the AC for armors.
> In the following table you can see how many resistance points have a special material depending on the material value. A material that replaces any of the materials mentioned in the table uses the resistance of the replaced material (for example, a [[Compendium/Materials/Coral|coral]] armor uses the metal resistance points) 
> 
> ##### Resistance Points by Value
> | Material Value | Clothing, non-metallic | Wood | Metal |
> |:----|:----:|:----:|:----:|
> | 100 or less  | 2 | 3 | 4 |
> | 101 - 500  | 3 | 4 | 5 |
> | 501 - 1.000 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
> | 1.001 or more | 5 | 6 | 7 |
> 
> ##### Repairing Equipment
> If you want to repair a piece of equipment made with a special material, you need to make a tools check using the required artisan tools. **The DC equals to 8 + total amount of reduced points**. 
> 
> Depending on what you're trying to repair, you need to use a number of units of the same material, as shown in the following table.
> 
> | Equipment type | Number of Material Units |
> |:----:|:-------------|
> | Armor  | 2 units |
> | Weapon | 1 unit |
> 
> If you pass the check, the equipment is repaired completely. If you fail the check, you can make another check when you finish a long rest.
> 
> ##### Common Items Resistance
> You can also apply this rules to common materials like iron and wood. Determine the resistance points using the market value of the items, and for repairing them you will need units of iron, wood, or any other common material.

# Modular Magic Items
Every magical item has special properties which can go from dealing additional damage, giving resistance to a particular damage type, allowing a character to cast spells, increase their attributes and more. This section gives both players and DMs some guidelines to create custom magic items, which can also be crafted using the previous rules.

The character level determines the recommended levels a character should have to gain access to a specific tier. For example, a 3rd level character should have a tier 1 item, while a 9th level character can have a tier 3 item or lower.

| Character Level | Item Tier | Properties' Rarity |
|:----|:---|:---|
| 1st-4th  | Tier 1 | Minor |
| 5th-8th  | Tier 2 | Uncommon |
| 9th-12th | Tier 3 | Rare |
| 13th-16th | Tier 4 | Very Rare |
| 17th-20th | Tier 5 | Legendary |

## Item Tiers
Any magic item created using this rules have an item tier, which determines the number and rarity of properties for that item. For more information about uncommon and rarer properties, see the [[The Complete Crafter#Item Properties|Item Properties]] section. 

A tier 1 item only have a minor property, and tier 2 and higher items can also have one minor property that gives a simple feature or effect to it for free. You can choose this property from the [[Dungeon Master's Guide#What Minor Property Does It Have|What Minor Property Does It Have?]] table found in the page 143 of the *Dungeon's Master Guide.* 

The following table shows the properties rarity for magic items for every tier.

##### Properties Rarity per Tier
| Tier | Property 1 | Property 2 | Property 3 |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Tier 1 | Minor | - | - |
| Tier 2 | Uncommon | Uncommon | - |
| Tier 3 | Rare | Rare | - |
| Tier 4 | Very Rare | Rare | Uncommon |
| Tier 5 | Legendary | Very Rare | Rare |

## Item Properties
In the following tables you can find various magical properties divided by type. It's up to the DM to determine if an item can have the same property multiple times and if its possible to add a property to a particular item. For example, a character can't add the Armor I property twice to a tier 3 magic armor, and that character cannot add the Weapon II or Vampiric II properties since an armor isn't made for dealing damage.

### Spells and Charges
If an item has the charges or spell properties, the creator must decide which spell wants to add when creating the item. The character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to add that spell to the item.

For items with the Spell property, a character can choose only one spell to add. The spell level is determined by the property rarity. For example, an item that have the Spell III property with the [[lightning bolt]] spell, that spell will be cast as a 7th-level spell every time a character uses it.

For items with charges, a character can choose to add various spells. The number of spells and the spell level is determined by the rarity of the property, as shown in the following table.

| Property | Number of Spells | Maximum Spell Level |
|:----|:----:|:----:|
| Charges I | 1 | 1st |
| Charges II | 2 | 3rd |
| Charges III | 3 | 5th |
| Charges IV | 4 | 6th |

Each charge equals to 1 spell slot level. For example, expending 1 charge allows the character to cast a 1st-level spell the item have, and expending 5 charges allows the character to cast a 5th-level spell the item have.

> [!info] Crafting Modular Magic Items
> If the DM allows it, a character can craft these items. To do so, determine the item rarity first, then, follow the downtime rules found in the [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]] to set the CR range, workweeks and gold cost for each item.

## Evolving Items
You can use the modular magic item rules for creating an item that will evolve with a specific character. First, make sure to give something to the item so it makes the character the only one to use it, such as adding a class prerequisite for attuning to the item. You can also link it with the character's story and important events, like being the weapon his father used when he was an adventurer.

### Evolving Requirements
To evolve an item to a tier, the character must be at least at the minimum level required for each tier to evolve the item. For example, a 7th level character cannot evolve his or her magic item to tier 3 until reaching 9th level.

Additionally, even if a character has level to evolve the item to the next tier, it's up to the DM to determine an additional task or a triggering event to allow the item to evolve. This requirement gives a bit of background to the item, and also allows the DM to create some special quests to discover the item hidden features. Here're some sample requirements you can use:

- The character must slay a number of creatures with the weapon.
- The item must be placed on the altar found in the top of an abandoned wizard tower.
- The character must gain a deity's favor.
- The character must defeat an old enemy of the weapon maker.
- The item evolves after saving a group of innocents from a dark ritual.
- The character must execute a light (or dark) ritual.
- The item evolves when the character makes a big sacrifice for a personal cause.

#### Item Tiers and Evolving Items
Whenever an item evolves into a new tier, you can upgrade the properties to a rarer level following the same table from the Item Tiers section.

***Tier 2.*** When it evolves to this tier, you can add two uncommon special properties to the item.

***Tier 3.*** When it evolves to this tier, you can upgrade the uncommon special properties to rare special properties.

***Tier 4.*** When it evolves to this tier, the item gains an extra uncommon special property and you can upgrade one rare special property to a very rare special property.

***Tier 5.*** When it evolves to this tier, you can upgrade one uncommon special property to a rare special property, one rare special property to a very rare special property, and one very rare special property to a Legendary property

#### Taking and Replacing Properties
Since this rules are based on evolving the weapon properties instead of changing them to other, I don't recommend replacing one property with another at higher tiers, but it's up to you if you want to do so. For example, replacing the *Damage II* property with the *Vampiric III* property when evolving to tier 4.

A reason for replacing properties could be related with the item background story or a very particular event, such as discovering that the item contains the soul of an evil creature, replacing the "good-aligned" properties when the soul is awakened, like replacing the Light I property to a Damage I property (necrotic) for a weapon. 

Alternatively, you can avoid taking one property at the beginning rarity, and then take a rarer property at higher tiers. For example, when creating an armor, you only choose the Ability Increase I property and left the second property empty at tier 2. Then, when the armor evolves to tier 3, you upgrade the Ability Increase to II and you also pick the Armor I for the second property.

### Triggering Event Example
A 3rd level character is rewarded with Igni, a [[longsword]] used by his family for generations to defend the city against evil. 
- Since he is a 3rd level character, the weapon is at tier 1, so it's just a basic [[longsword]] with a nice name, a background history, and the Guardian minor property (for now).

The character continues its adventures using the [[longsword]], and after some adventures he reaches level 5. In this moment, his father tells him that the [[longsword]] has special abilities, and the character needs to prove himself worthy to unleash those abilities. For this, he must destroy an old fire elemental that attacked the city years ago. 
- In this case, the character have the first requirement completed (reach level 5 to evolve the weapon to tier 2), but the weapon will not evolve until the character kills the fire elemental mentioned by his father.

After reaching 6th level, the character decides to enter the elemental lair and fight with the creature, and at the moment he destroys the elemental, the essence of the creature is drained by the [[longsword]], and with that the weapon evolves to tier 2, giving the weapon a +1 to attack and damage and an extra **+**``dice: 1d4`` fire damage on a hit.

### Evolving Weapon Example

#### Igni (Tier 1)
*Weapon (longsword), common (requires attunement)*
___
Same stats as the [[longsword]] found in the [[Player's Handbook]], plus the guardian minor property (+2 on initiative rolls if the bearer isn't [[incapacitated]]).

#### Igni (Tier 2)
*Weapon (longsword), uncommon (requires attunement)*
___
When a character evolves Igni to this tier, apply the following changes to the item's traits:

- You gain a +1 on attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional ``dice: 1d4`` fire damage.

#### Igni (Tier 3)
*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*
___
When a character evolves Igni to this tier, apply the following changes to the item's traits:
- Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls to a +2
- The fire damage dealt by attacks with this weapon increases to ``dice: 1d6``.

#### Igni (Tier 4)
*Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)*
___
When a character evolves Igni to this tier, apply the following changes to the item's traits:
- The fire damage dealt by attacks with this weapon increases to ``dice: 1d8``.
- As an action, you can cast the [[fireball]] spell at 3rd level (DC 11). After using this ability, you need to finish a long rest.

#### Igni, Soul of the Fire (Tier 5)
*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)*
___
When a character evolves Igni to this tier, apply the following changes to the item's traits:
- Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls to a +3
- The fire damage dealt by attacks with this weapon increases to ``dice: 1d10``.
- As an action, you can now cast the [[fireball]] spell at 6th level (DC 13). After using this ability, you need to finish a long rest.

# Parts by Creature
In the following section you will find some example materials a character can get from creatures. This list doesn't includes weapons, armor, or any kind of gear the creature have. Instead, the list can help players and DMs to determine what they can harvest from each creature. Remember that every creature have 1 unit of the creature type essence that can be extracted using a [[Essence Extraction Device]].

The list also includes the total amount of each part a character can harvest. This list doesn't consider bones, meat, blood, or common organs. Some creatures have particular organs listed because they grant benefits or features to the creature, such as the essential organ that gives a dragon its breath weapon. Read the Collecting Materials section to see how many harvest checks the characters can make per creature.
